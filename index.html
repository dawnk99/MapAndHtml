<h1> The Bronx Is Warming Up To Donald Trump</h1>
<h2> President Elect Trump's 2024 Support in the South Bronx Sees Big Gains from 2016 </h2>

<p> by Dawn Kikel <br> December 20, 2024 </p>

<!-- Body of Story -->
<p>From 2016 to 2024 in the South Bronx Assembly Districts, Donald Trump’s number of votes grew. It highlights his growing appeal to people of color. In 2016 he garnered approximately 5% of the vote in the Assembly Districts representing the area of the Bronx with the lowest incomes.  In 2024 that percentage grew to approximately 25%</p>

<p>Michael Randino, Chairman of the Bronx Republican Party, said, “To have a presidential candidate come here not just once but then come a second time, that resonated with people. It mattered to Bronx voters." According to Randino, members of the party registered thousands of people at the events they held around the borough for the 2024 election. </p>

<p>The Bronx has a heavily Democratic-leaning population that has consistently awarded its votes to the Dems. While Trump didn't win the Bronx, the fact that he gained so much momentum over his elections is noteworthy. </p>
